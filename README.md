## 🔧 **Pattern Implementations**

### 🔄 **Iterator Pattern**
Provides uniform access to different collection types without exposing internal structure.

**Key Classes:**
- `IIterator<T>` - Defines iteration interface
- `SlotsCatalog` - Uses `List<T>` internally
- `TableGamesCatalog` - Uses `Array` internally
- Both provide the same iteration experience!

### 🌳 **Composite Pattern**  
Composes objects into tree structures and treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Key Classes:**
- `GameComponent` - Base component for uniform treatment
- `CasinoGame` - Leaf nodes (individual casino games)
- `GameCategory` - Composite nodes (game category containers)
- `GameManager` - Client that works with entire hierarchy
