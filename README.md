## ?? **Overview**

This interactive console application demonstrates the **Iterator Pattern** and **Composite Pattern** from the legendary book "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson. 

The demo uses the classic **restaurant menu system** scenario to show how these patterns solve real-world problems in an engaging, educational way.

### ?? **What You'll Learn**
- **Iterator Pattern**: Uniform access to different collection types
- **Composite Pattern**: Building and managing tree structures  
- **Pattern Synergy**: How these patterns work beautifully together
- **Real-World Application**: Practical examples you can apply immediately

## ?? **Pattern Implementations**

### ?? **Iterator Pattern**
Provides uniform access to different collection types without exposing internal structure.

**Key Classes:**
- `IIterator<T>` - Defines iteration interface
- `PancakeHouseMenu` - Uses `List<T>` internally
- `DinerMenu` - Uses `Array` internally
- Both provide the same iteration experience!

### ?? **Composite Pattern**  
Composes objects into tree structures and treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Key Classes:**
- `MenuComponent` - Base component for uniform treatment
- `MenuItem` - Leaf nodes (individual menu items)
- `Menu` - Composite nodes (menu containers)
- `Waitress` - Client that works with entire hierarchy

---

## ?? **Perfect for Presentations**

### ?? **For Speakers/Trainers**
- **Single window experience** - no IDE switching needed
- **Built-in code examples** - patterns displayed in console
- **Interactive pacing** - audience can follow along
- **Professional appearance** - clean, bordered code blocks
- **Complete coverage** - theory + practical implementation

### ?? **For Audiences**
- **Clear learning progression** - problem ? solution ? benefits
- **Real working code** - see actual implementations
- **Interactive engagement** - active participation required
- **Memorable experience** - visual and interactive elements
- **Reference material** - everything needed in one demo

## ?? **Testing**

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with **15 tests** covering:

- **Iterator Pattern Edge Cases** - Empty collections, capacity limits, multiple iterators
- **Composite Pattern Behavior** - Tree traversal, recursive operations, nested structures  
- **Integration Scenarios** - Patterns working together, client code usage
- **Error Handling** - Proper exception throwing and boundary conditions

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --verbosity normal

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=IteratorTests"
```

## ?? **Key Learning Outcomes**

After running this demo, you'll understand:

### **Iterator Pattern**
- ? **Uniform Access** - Same interface for different collections
- ? **Encapsulation** - Internal structure hidden from clients  
- ? **Extensibility** - Easy to add new collection types
- ? **Single Responsibility** - Iteration logic separated from business logic

### **Composite Pattern**  
- ? **Tree Structures** - Elegant handling of hierarchical data
- ? **Uniform Treatment** - Same operations on leaves and composites
- ? **Recursive Operations** - Operations propagate through entire tree
- ? **Client Simplicity** - Client doesn't need to distinguish node types

### **Pattern Synergy**
- ? **Combined Power** - Iterator traverses Composite structures beautifully
- ? **Real-World Application** - Practical scenarios you'll encounter
- ? **Design Principles** - Open/Closed Principle, Single Responsibility
- ? **Best Practices** - Clean, maintainable, extensible code
