## 🔧 **Pattern Implementations**

### 🔄 **Iterator Pattern**
Provides uniform access to different collection types without exposing internal structure.

**Key Classes:**
- `IIterator<T>` - Defines iteration interface
- `SlotsCatalog` - Uses `List<T>` internally
- `TableGamesCatalog` - Uses `Array` internally
- Both provide the same iteration experience!

### 🌳 **Composite Pattern**  
Composes objects into tree structures and treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Key Classes:**
- `GameComponent` - Base component for uniform treatment
- `CasinoGame` - Leaf nodes (individual casino games)
- `GameCategory` - Composite nodes (game category containers)
- `GameManager` - Client that works with entire hierarchy

---

## 🎤 **Perfect for Presentations**

### 🎯 **For Speakers/Trainers**
- **Single window experience** - no IDE switching needed
- **Built-in code examples** - patterns displayed in console
- **Interactive pacing** - audience can follow along
- **Professional appearance** - clean, bordered code blocks
- **Complete coverage** - theory + practical implementation

### 👥 **For Audiences**
- **Clear learning progression** - problem → solution → benefits
- **Real working code** - see actual implementations
- **Interactive engagement** - active participation required
- **Memorable experience** - visual and interactive elements
- **Reference material** - everything needed in one demo

## 🧪 **Testing**

The project includes a comprehensive test suite with **19 tests** covering:

- **Iterator Pattern Edge Cases** - Empty collections, capacity limits, multiple iterators
- **Composite Pattern Behavior** - Tree traversal, recursive operations, nested structures  
- **Integration Scenarios** - Patterns working together, client code usage
- **Error Handling** - Proper exception throwing and boundary conditions

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --verbosity normal

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=IteratorTests"
```

## 🎯 **Key Learning Outcomes**

After running this demo, you'll understand:

### **Iterator Pattern**
- ✅ **Uniform Access** - Same interface for different collections
- ✅ **Encapsulation** - Internal structure hidden from clients  
- ✅ **Extensibility** - Easy to add new collection types
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - Iteration logic separated from business logic

### **Composite Pattern**  
- ✅ **Tree Structures** - Elegant handling of hierarchical data
- ✅ **Uniform Treatment** - Same operations on leaves and composites
- ✅ **Recursive Operations** - Operations propagate through entire tree
- ✅ **Client Simplicity** - Client doesn't need to distinguish node types

### **Pattern Synergy**
- ✅ **Combined Power** - Iterator traverses Composite structures beautifully
- ✅ **Real-World Application** - Practical scenarios in gaming industry
- ✅ **Design Principles** - Open/Closed Principle, Single Responsibility
- ✅ **Best Practices** - Clean, maintainable, extensible code

### **Game Catalog Management**
- **Multiple Providers** - Different game providers use different data structures
- **Category Hierarchies** - Slots, Table Games, Live Casino with subcategories
- **Promotional Games** - Special categories for bonus games and promotions
- **RTP Filtering** - Easy filtering of games by Return to Player percentage

### **Real-World Scenarios**
- **Slots Catalog** - Uses `List<T>` for dynamic game additions
- **Table Games Catalog** - Uses `Array` for fixed capacity management
- **Live Casino** - Nested categories for different dealer studios
- **VIP Games** - Exclusive high-stakes game categories

---
